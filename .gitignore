Dear DevOps Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

Iâ€™m reaching out to request your assistance in enabling the following route in Kong for the Fee Management project in the Dev environment. This is required to address a CORS issue that is affecting the functionality of our application.

Details:
Service: fee-management-backend
Name/ID: fee-management-backend
Path: /v1/fee/group
Method: GET
We believe enabling this route will resolve the current issue and ensure seamless integration with the frontend.

Please let me know if you need any further details or configurations from our side. Your prompt assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]
